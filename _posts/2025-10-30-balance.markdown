# Some tips I aim to follow every semester:

- At the beginning of every semester make a schedule combining all the due dates for your classes into one centralized location. This way you don't forget about assignments that would otherwise creep up on you.
- Be realistic: If you know that a semester will be more challenging academically, be prepared to make sacrifices in other areas of life. This could mean prioritizing schoolwork over hanging out with friends.
- With that in mind, keep a balance! College is the time to make connections so while you need to devote time to getting schoolwork done, you also need to devote time to maintaining friendships with your peers.
- Don't sacrifice personal health. Without taking care of yourself, there is no way you will realistically be able to complete your coursework to your highest ability or maintain personal relations. Things like carving out consistent meal times and sleep schedule can make a huge difference.
